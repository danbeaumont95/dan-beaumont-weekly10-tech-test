# Daniel Beaumont Weekly10 Tech Test

This is my tech test for weekly10.

The aim of this code is to create a JavaScript function to convert any English sentence into 'Pig Latin'.

Pig latin is a made-up 'language' where the first character of each word has 'ay' added to it and it is prepended to the end of that word.

I have written the code in JavaScript and the tests using Jest.

&nbsp;


An example of Pig latin is:

convertToPigLatin('walking the dog') === 'alkingway hetay ogday'
